## Introduction

Hello everyone ! My name is Maxence Potier, I have 22 years old and I am a studient at Holberton School Paris. This is the last project of my first year and I hope you will like it.

This project is a social network to help to find your gym partner. I have this idea because i go to the gym almost everyday but sometimes i don't have motivation and I would like to have someone to train with. I'm sure I'm not the only one in this case so I decided to develop a social network to answer this problem.

I decided to develop this project with a MERN Architecture. For more information on the developpement of the project I recommend you to write my article : [link](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/my-portfolio-project-maxence-potier)

## Installation

Install all the front-end libraires : ```cd client``` + ```npm i```

Create a cluster with MongoDB Atlas and then configure the file ```./config/db.js```
Create a file ```.env``` in the folder ```config``` and config the variables :
 - PORT = ```Port for back-end```
